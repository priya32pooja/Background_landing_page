            <h1>Wonderful<br><span>Island</span></h1>
            <p>India has two groups of islands. The Lakshadweep islands are located in the Arabian Sea close to the 
                Malabar Coast of Kerala. These are the small group of the coral islands. Kavaratti Island is 
                the administrative capital of the Lakshadweep. The Pitt Island is uninhabited and has a bird sanctuary. 
                The Andaman and Nicobar islands are located in the Bay of Bengal and are an elevated portion of the 
                submarine mountains. Since these islands lie close to the Equator, the climate remains hot and wet throughout 
                the year and has dense forests.</p>

            <h1>Feel Nature<br><span>Relax</span></h1>
            <p>Are you glued to a phone, computer, tablet or other screen for most of the day? Itâ€™s time to take a break, unplug and head outdoors. 
                Connecting with nature is healing. 
                Studies have shown that taking time to unplug and be outside, with no goal beyond just experiencing 
                the world around you, has a positive effect on your well-being. Spending time in nature can improve 
                memory, lower stress hormones, and reduce feelings of depression or anxiety, among other perks.
                Being in nature can help clear your head and bring you into the present moment, and is a great way to 
                de-stress and relax.</p>

            <h1>Aventures<br><span>Off Road</span></h1>
            <p>An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. 
                Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, 
                scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create 
                psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge 
                that can only be obtained by such activities.</p>
